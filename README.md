**Hello FiveM community!ðŸ‘‹**\
We have created an crypto mining system for the qbcore framework. The overall idea for this script is that I have yet to find a free one which works.

**This is WIP project.**

# Key Features of this Resource:
 1. 

# How To Install
* Drag and drop `razed-cryptomining`
* In your `server.cfg` add `ensure razed-cryptomining`
* Execute the `cryptomining.sql` into your database

# Recomendations From Us
* If using `ps-housing`, we reccomend to change the price of the server rack prop to the appropriate price of a mining rig.
